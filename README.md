This plugin allows to create random print layouts kept in specific map style. You don't have to worry about layers order, choosing the right colors or adding matching images to your layouts anymore! Just choose the style you want to keep your map in and our plugin will generate your own amazing layout, that you can either just save at your computer or change a bit according to your own taste.
